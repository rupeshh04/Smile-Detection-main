Smile Detector - using OpenCV to detect smiling faces in a video or in live webcam.
Hope You Will Like It and you can also use the code to make your own version.
<br><br>
The primary objective of the current project is to detect smiling of the user using haar_cascade dataset provided and distributed with [OpenCV][opencv].

## Requirements
1.  OpenCV

## What is OpenCV?
OpenCV is an open-source library for computer vision, with a focus on real-time applications. It focuses mainly on video capture/processing, image processing, and analysis (like face and object detection). It has many built-in functions and pre-trained models, so we don’t have to worry about training and testing of algorithms.

---
## Installation of OpenCV :
To install the OpenCV library for Python execute the following line in a terminal/command window:
```sh
pip install opencv-python
```

If you are on Windows and the line above does not work then download the OpenCV wheel from the [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages Website][win-open-cv-wheel].
